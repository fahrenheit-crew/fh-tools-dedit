# Fahrenheit Dialogue Editor (DEdit)
---

DEdit is a standalone application that utilizes Fahrenheit's
``FhCharset`` API to perform transformations between UTF-8
and game encoding. Resulting dialogue files can be distributed
alongside Fahrenheit mods and replace original game dialogue
using the External File Loader.

All transformations DEdit offers are also available at runtime for Fahrenheit mods.

### Obtaining releases

Releases are available in the
[main Fahrenheit repository](https://github.com/peppy-enterprises/fahrenheit/releases).

### Building from source

DEdit is built alongside Fahrenheit. Clone the
[main Fahrenheit repository](https://github.com/peppy-enterprises/fahrenheit/releases) to begin,
and build it using the instructions in that repository.

Debug builds of DEdit can be run from Visual Studio.
Release builds can be generated and placed in the correct place with the
[`tools/deploy.ps1` script](https://github.com/peppy-enterprises/fahrenheit/blob/main/tools/deploy.ps1).

### Usage

The simplest and recommended way to use DEdit is to place arguments
into a response file, one argument per line, then invoke DEdit as such:
```
PS> cat test.rsp
decompile
-i
"znkd0900.bin"
"znkd1000.bin"
"znkd1300.bin"
"znkd1200.bin"
"znkd1400.bin"
-o
D:\work\dedit\test
-l
Chinese
-g
FFX
-it
I32_X2
```
```
.\fhdedit.exe '@test.rsp'
```

At a minimum you must specify any number of input files (`-i`),
the selected game type (`-g`), game language (`-l`), index type
(`-it`), and an output folder (`-o`). The output folder must already exist.

The following commands and arguments are available:
```
